<p>This EP consists of one cover of mine and an original tune, all performed by a prominent Portland, Oregon based pianist and composer David Goldblatt. “Kozimnin Qarasy” is my rearrangement of a old Kazakh folk song, originally written by musician and poet Abai Qunanbaiuly in the middle of XIX century. “Alexandria” is a dedication to a friend of mine, a vision of whom I had in my dream in the winter of 2019, where she was singing that melody. Once I transcribed and harmonized it, this tune- “Alexandria”- was born. Recorded in the Goldblatts’ house basement studio in May 2020, when I was  housed by my good friend Jordan Goldblatt during the global pandemic, which led me to being homeless in America for a while, this EP occupies a special place in my heart. One could consider this a lyrical work even.</p>
