<p>“Walking Meditations” is an experimental concept album. Those lengthy tracks, essentially, are field recordings of my autumn 2020 walking meditation practices, where I was expreimenting with meditation in different settings, including those full with noise, distractions and people. All four tracks are bound with one idea and, if necessary, one might think of it as Musique Concrete rather.</p>
