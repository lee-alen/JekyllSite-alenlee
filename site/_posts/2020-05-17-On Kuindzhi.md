Arkhip Kuindzhi was a prominent Russian late-romantic era landscape painter of greek descent. This whole album is heavily influenced by some of the most famous works by Kuindzhi and, in fact, all tracks here are musical interpretations of same-titled paintings in free solo piano improvisation. It was recorded by Spencer Hauck in one of California Institute of the Arts' practice rooms in the winter of 2019 and released in the spring of 2020.
